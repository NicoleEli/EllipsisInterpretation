Its position on abortion itself was hardly ambiguous: the minutes of the Assembly meeting for 1982 point out �[the Assembly's] opposition to abortion on demand for purely social reasons, or as a means of birth control � [and] that in exceptional circumstances, where medical abortion might be necessary, the most stringent safeguards should be provided to prevent abuse� (Presbyterian Church in Ireland 1930�86, General Assembly (1982), p. 61). :: NPE

By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution.... An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not. But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network.  :: VPE
What Ms. Pfeiffer had going for her besides determination -- Ms. Stevens recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine " -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. " we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," Ms. Stevens said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training."  :: VPE
So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth. She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift. She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like "T " and "K." She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics. And please, Michelle, when you sing the line in "Makin' Whoopee," about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say "funn-ih," the way Dylan would. Say "funn-eeee." Put the clean vowel ending on it.

First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington. Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ( " " banks and institutions ) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun. The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders. I can assure Mr. Wanniski that the market is not as politically motivated as he is.  :: VPE
Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5 % to 10 %, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined.

But raising stock-index futures margins could make the stock market even more volatile, futures traders contend. Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business.

Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture. But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff. Among other things, they said, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label.  :: VPE
The agreement is said to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.

Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar.

All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.  :: VPE

The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.  :: VPE
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.

And they will again, say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme.

The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit. Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987.  :: VPE
"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. " the market being up to2,700 or2,800 and the existence of derivative products... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had."  :: VPE
Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.  :: VPE
Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.  :: VPE
These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.  :: VPE
The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.  :: VPE
Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market. The bank was in touch with other major central banks over the weekend and was preparing to make capital available to dealers if needed, as it did in the 1987 crash, according to people familiar with the bank's strategy.  :: VPE
Many are quick to emphasize that just because the market can fall as fast as it did Friday doesn't mean it will tank again, despite some disquieting similarities between now and October 1987. As in 1987, this latest market slide was preceded by sparring between nations and government officials over the dollar.  :: VPE
If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.  :: VPE
