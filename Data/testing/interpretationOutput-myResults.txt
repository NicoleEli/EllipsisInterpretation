Sentence: Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar. But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines. All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.

Sentence: The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says.

Sentence: The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\ % from its levels of just below 9 % last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit.

Sentence: Those sound like innocuous changes, but they're not. Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money, the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets. Congressional pressures on the Fed similar to those that produced the savings and loan mess are an awful thought.
Antecedent: changes

Good		xBad

Sentence: Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.
Antecedent: null

Good		xBad

Sentence: These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.
Antecedent: null

Good		xBad

Sentence: The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth ( see accompanying charts -- WSJ Oct. 17, 1989 ). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.

Sentence: If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies. Those transactions, in turn, could weaken the dollar. Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities, they reduce the demand for dollars.
