I mean, Nestle had to abandon that. Mhm. -- Ack
I mean, Nestle had to abandon that. Yes. -- Ack
Well, yes, I suppose one of the questions you could ask is, is there a boycott against the company? Right. -- Ack
They moved the Hoover factory from France to Yes. -- Ack
It's really a question of finding out where the material is coming from and knowing what the conditions are like there. Mm. -- Ack
Some things they're obliged to tell you where those come from aren't they? Yes. -- Ack
I have thought of a question. Good. -- FactMod
Erm because as Moira said that Kraft is erm <pause> now what was she saying, what was she saying Kraft is the same as <pause> Craft? -- CE

I think I'll give you some homework that you could do for the week. Right.  -- Ack
based on, what we do today will be based on Okay. -- Ack
How many notes are there in a scale? Eight. -- ShortAns_arg
Eight. Right. -- Ack
So each one of those is going to have a <pause> a name of its own Yeah. -- Ack
You, you've probably heard that name before. Yeah. -- Ack
Or in the key of G it would be A. A. -- RepAck
<pause> The mediant is the third degree of the scale Yeah. -- Ack
Dominant means that it's important doesn't it? Yeah. -- Ack
So that becomes submediant. Right. -- Ack
So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. Right. -- Ack
So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. Yeah. -- Ack
That <trunc> jus </trunc> if, if you can keep the <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> the descriptions in your mind as well it just helps you to, to remember why each one is called that. Yeah. -- Ack
Did you have to go as far as that? No. -- Reject
No.  Right. -- Ack
No.  Okay. -- Ack
C to E major third. Major third. -- RepAck
But it is actually called a perfect octave as well. Okay. -- Ack
You have C to D flat. -- Filler
That becomes a minor second. Right. -- Ack
Fourths and fifths you don't have minors.  Right  -- Ack
That's the sixth. Minor sixth. -- HelpReject
So you've then got a minor second, a third, a sixth and a seventh. Right. -- Ack
must have, if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it? Yeah. -- Ack
Now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths. Alright. -- Ack
C to A would be <pause> A double flat which would on a keyboard be a G. G. -- RepAck
Do you have to go through the minor? No. -- Reject
bigger. Oh yeah. -- Ack
So it's going the other way. Right. -- Ack
So that would be a D sharp. A D sharp. -- RepAck
Which is two whole semitones less than the major interval Yeah. -- Ack
And then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals. Yeah. -- Ack
A diminished interval from any of the intervals. And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. -- ConjFrag
And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. Right. -- Ack
Let's call it by its proper name, tonic. Tonic. -- RepAck
Augmented fifth would be a C sharp. Right. -- Ack
C flat. C flat. -- RepAck
That's a fourth. Oh yeah. -- Ack
That's right. Yeah. -- Ack
That's right. Okay. -- Ack
That's what we normally use it for and erm <pause> what I'm going to do if that's okay is I, I'll describe the erm <pause> the actual theory to you Mm. -- Ack
And I've got a little chart that I'll give you to do that on. Mm. -- Ack
And then erm we'll have three readings, really, of erm <pause> where you come Mm. -- Ack
One of which is this erm estimate that you'll do now. Mm. -- Ack
And then you've filled in a works situations Mm. -- Ack
questionnaire, and that gives us another reading. Mm. -- Ack
And then there's the proper questionnaire and I've scored that up. Right. -- Ack
So we get three readings. Okay? -- CheckQu
Now erm <pause> oh you've got a pen. Excellent. -- FactMod
The way it works is that the theory, the theory actually erm er has four dimensions. Mm. -- Ack
And the idea is that that's the midpoint and there's a one to ten scale going each way. Mm. -- Ack
And the theory is that every individual has an innate inborn preference for behaving at one end or the other. Okay? -- CheckQu
Are you right or left handed? Right handed. -- ShortAns_arg
How did you feel while you were trying <shift>? Er really strange actually. -- ShortAns_arg
and er I have a real problem with using my left hand. Oh interesting. -- FactMod
Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at, in order to discover the preference, we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity, once you've found the preferences, they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other. Right. -- Ack
works. Okay? -- CheckQu
works. Okay. -- Ack
This, this dimension is about er where you prefer to focus your attention and where you get your psychological energy from. Okay? -- CheckQu
Erm and then, they may share. Right. -- Ack
to write, or something to buy in town, or whatever you know Mm. -- Ack
They thought it over and they've worked out, and they're not gonna come. Right. -- Ack
Do I put a cross? Yes. -- AffAns
It's about perception. Mm. -- Ack

if you have R ten times what it was in the <trunc> pres </trunc> the previous one, you'll now only get a tenth of the current out. Yeah. -- Ack

In fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm I've never felt that erm it's, I mean maybe <pause> just my <pause> erm silliness really but I, I never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office I stayed put as it were until it was time to go home and I could have taken the dog I suppose during the lunch hour but I preferred that time to erm to reading Mm. -- Ack
and just relaxing and erm in any case as I say er guide dogs were few and far between at that time Mm mm. -- Ack
and I've never wanted one since because er luckily I've got erm my wife who, we get about together. Mm. -- Ack
Yes it's erm <pause> it was seventy five pounds a year at age nineteen Mm. -- Ack

I think it was about forty four Mm. -- Ack
but of course erm as a sort of public to the er, er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting a bit grim on the war front, it was decided that erm, we should work extra hours as erm, <unclear> to show that we were pulling our weight <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift>, so we used to, instead of starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five, and working on Saturdays as well of course, erm, we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a fiasco really because nobody erm, you know, well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time <pause> Mm. -- Ack
you were really kicking your heels and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was dusk because er, of course you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was <unclear> it became really thick Mm. -- Ack
mm, I don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job, I mean they, they were, er perhaps that's a bit unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm <shift new=laughing> pretty dreadful <shift> Mm. -- Ack
with all the books and files around and er, it became, anybody with any chest troubles erm Mm. -- Ack
found it <trunc> v </trunc> very difficult cos erm atmosphere as I say was erm really dreadful Mm. -- Ack
it got very hot and erm stuffy and unpleasant Mm. -- Ack
so erm, and that went on for, I suppose till the end of the war when er, when we had a reduction in hours again, we went back to the normal nine till half past five. Mm. -- Ack
and erm <pause> I don't know what the idea really was, I think it was possibly so that erm, that people concerned with the Committee Meetings could erm sort themselves out and Mm. -- Ack
at least as far as I can remember. Mm mm. -- Ack

er we had quite a number of married women coming in to er, to work as part of their war effort and erm, so that <pause> there was quite, there was quite erm <pause> quick turnover of staff at that time Mm. -- Ack

story. Yes. -- Ack
Very, very little really, erm we had contact with other Authorities of course, in the course, in erm er particularly in connection with evacuation, erm <pause> evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and, and time at that er particularly initially because erm Suffolk was in a peculiar position or at least the East Suffolk was, erm at the beginning of the war of course erm East Suffolk was an evacuation, er was erm a reception area Mm. -- Ack

but erm it had sorted itself out after, well more or less after a week or two a lot of the evacuees of course didn't stay very long, they went back home because erm <pause> I know mother had a, a little boy from erm Guildford when we lived at Debenham and er he went back after a while, the mother used to come down and visit him from time to time, they were very, came from very poor circumstances and the Mm. -- Ack

Six o'clock news erm And seven o'clock and nine -- ConjFrag
So she watched television and erm <pause> Princess Diana erm <pause> said something shocking at lunchtime at a luncheon party or lunch party and erm <pause> maybe just erm ten days before that Princess Diana's announcement we were told by the Register Teacher that we will have an assignment of in February and we will compare some newspapers articles and maybe she didn't explain very erm specifically but she just gave us erm the brief information about er register assignment in February and she told us that we should er we should collect some newspapers <pause> about the same title was about the same <pause> topic and <trunc> ho </trunc> we should compare how each newspaper treated, treats the <pause> er news or <pause> what do you call that? Well the news item the story, the story. -- ShortAns_arg
So the next day it was <trunc> Sa </trunc> Saturday er Saturday morning we went to <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> er <pause> can I call that that shop? Yes <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> yes, yes <unclear> -- RepAffAns
Yes <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> yes, yes <unclear> Okay <sic resp=LONGMAN> Jameson </sic> er Bookshop in George Street and we bought six newspapers <pause> tabloid, three tabloid or er three  -- RepAck
<unclear> sheet. Broadsheet. -- RepAck
Peter, would you like to talk about language register in tabloids and broadsheets? Okay. -- AffAns
But very often I think tabloid journalism is interesting in terms of language <unclear> because it's very punchy it's succinct because <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> in some of our terms you might find people into a three minute reader and a thirty minute reader <pause> because in attention span and intellectual capacity are quite different <pause> but to actually condense something <pause> into meaningful short bursts, even if they are politically biased actually requires a certain amount of skill I would suspect <vocal desc="clears throat"> the clarity index which I can't find is the process that I mentioned the other night where you take <pause> erm some people call it the fog index <pause> a <pause> correct me if I'm wrong in my figures, but I think it's a piece of something like two hundred or three hundred words <pause> you count the number of <trunc> suc </trunc> erm colons and full stops or is it only full stops? Full stops. -- RepAffAns
Full stops. Full stops. -- RepAck
You then count the number of words of more than two syllables Mm. -- Ack
I mean like I saw a double-decker bus on the moon and that sort of stuff. Mm. -- Ack
It may be highly critical that the actual language will be completely different in the register. Yes. -- Ack
They will go for vocabulary which is highly charged with imagery and emotion. Mm. -- Ack
The others will chip in if they agree, but they will <pause> they are, they are wanting to set a missile to move, they're wanting to send a bullet, they are wanting to <trunc> s </trunc> to evoke emotion or anger or rage or frustration or political bias or to change attitudes now for example the interesting thing about the Princess Diana erm the headline on one of those tabloids which talks about exile <pause> is I suspect that they want to evoke the constitutional crisis which there was at the time of <pause> Edward. -- Filler
There was a special dispensation given to her to attend and in fact there were photographs at the time with the Queen with her. Yes. -- Ack
But, but, but the whole social and cultural <pause> revolution evolution change has led I think to <pause> whole different schisms in the press which perhaps may have existed in some of the very one might almost say near communist publication like the <unclear> Daily Worker. -- Filler
You'd be there six o'clock gone mate. Wonderful. -- FactMod
You see one of the other interesting things is that there is a <pause> essentially a tradition in this country that the Royal Family do not sue newspapers Yes. -- Ack
There are various exceptions erm <pause> and there have been two or three in recent years, but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything <pause> so they were fair game for a very sensational headline <pause> because there was very little chance of recrimination. Mm. -- Ack
Now the view er was that they were dignified and above taking action <pause> and also in the sense that the public was credited I think with more sense than to believe everything <pause> and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action, you are merely making the thing <pause> worse <pause> erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly actionable one day, become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can, one of the classics maybe is about the Prince of Wales talking to his plants, now that <unclear> a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches Mm. -- Ack
and it's become <unclear> of the exchange of, of, of talk and of media erm <pause> but what else do we say about language register and vocabulary? Length of words -- ShortAns_arg
Length of words Oh yes. -- Ack
I'm not sure, but I think when I studied this in college I think it was something like the average of <unclear> producers of vocabulary of less than two thousand words. Mm. -- Ack
Do you think it would be greater now? No, no actually no, not at all. -- Reject
I think that that is, is something that you know we looked at the <unclear> you know the Mirror that you know while thirty years ago they were doing short punchy stories and they maintained that, that there was actually <pause> A wider range of vocabulary  -- Filler
I mean I think you'll find that erm <pause> that there was an <trunc> amaz </trunc> you know I mean that, that while the language might have been simple <pause> it wasn't simplistic <pause> and, but the change in a <pause> in a way now is <unclear> around. Yeah. -- Ack
Do you know, do you know, am I being clear about that? Yeah  -- AffAns
Do you know, do you know, am I being clear about that? Yes  -- AffAns
One, the good, bad the <pause> the good, the bad and the unacceptable. Mhm. -- Ack
I would say that was in the Independent. Yeah. -- Ack
We will do what we can to er speed things and to catch up. Yes, Neil? -- Ack
Erm I see <unclear dur=8> so I'm not really <pause> <shift new=laughing> <unclear> <shift> will make sure that erm <pause> that we are kept in touch so that we are not so far down the track but they can't be reversed <unclear> committee as a whole  Absolutely.  -- PropMod
I understand <trunc> an </trunc> and appreciate <trunc> wh </trunc> what you're saying and most grateful to you for that, I think <trunc> wha </trunc> what you're, Neil <gap reason=anonymization desc="last or full name"> is saying is is that with <unclear> we must make sure the time, that this main strategic planning he has to look at, this very important issue, allows sufficient time for mature consideration Yes. -- Ack
<trunc> I </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> it may not be so, but it may be so Yes. -- Ack
I shall be getting a copy of this tape. Right. -- Ack
Er Chairman I'm <pause> perhaps I could also suggest that we change the word suggested erm <pause> because that <pause> <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> it, perhaps you are looking for something slightly stronger erm er so it could just say in accordance with paragraphs two four to two nine or the points made in paragraph two point <unclear> Mm. -- Ack
She's very concerned and the present line partial though it be, represents a <pause> a blight situation on that, on the, on potential er occupants of that line <pause> and certainly erm <pause> I find myself more in <pause> in er agreement with Darcy's views than I do with the other two councillors of East Grinstead, that's not er not secret No, no no  -- Reject
I, I think Chairman that as, as we come out of the recession <trunc> an </trunc> and <pause> <trunc> th </trunc> that the overall erm level er quantity of development taking place increases, then we are almost bound to see perhaps more affordable housing erm in absolute terms, although I don't see any opportunity of there being a <pause> a major hiccup in proportional terms, so I, I, like you, I think I remain er pessimistic er regarding the, the, the overview, although we might see er a turning up of the er of the graph having been bumping along the bottom for a little time a little while. Yes, thank you Chairman. -- Ack
Basically erm I agree with what you say but that the County Council itself of course is <pause> a landowner of erm some quite attractive erm areas of land that could be used for below cost housing, but the problem in the past has been that they always had to sell erm at the <pause> market price. Precisely. -- PropMod

been working on What? <u who=PS3SS> -- CE
What? <u who=PS3SS> Graphs. <u who=PS3SR> -- ShortAns_arg
Graphs. <u who=PS3SR> Graphs. -- RepAck
<pause> <unclear> important thing about graphs. Erm. -- Ack
<pause> What would you get marks for? The axes. -- ShortAns_arg
<pause> What would you get marks for? The <pause> points -- ShortAns_arg
The <pause> points Which <trunc> parti </trunc> <unclear> particular points? -- Sluice
Which <trunc> parti </trunc> <unclear> particular points? Points given for <pause> like co-ordinates. <u who=PS3SR> -- ShortAns_arg
Erm let's <unclear>, if they say sketch a graph, Right. <u who=PS3SR> -- Ack
What would be the interesting parts of the shape? Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. -- ShortAns_arg
Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point? <pause> -- RepAck
So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one. Mm. -- Ack
Any idea what that graph would be? <pause> X squared. -- ShortAns_arg
Erm, what would <pause> <unclear> not quite the right shape <unclear> <pause> what would that graph be? Y equals something <pause> plus X squared. -- ShortAns_arg
And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant Mm. -- Ack
So that's going to be minus something Mm. -- Ack
What about this one? Y equals X squared. -- ShortAns_arg
It's gonna be about plus three, three plus. Mm. -- Ack
Where's the X, where's the Y? X squared. -- ShortAns_arg
So it'll be something like <pause> X minus three X squared. Mm. -- Ack
So X equal three or X equal three. Yeah. -- Ack
Y would be six, <unclear>. <pause> Mhm. -- Ack
What's Y equal to, roughly? Just over six, six point -- ShortAns_arg
Just over six, six point Six and a bit. -- RepAck
What does it approximate to? Erm minus infinity. -- ShortAns_arg
<pause> at minus a million. Erm -- Ack
What would that approximate to? A million plus six. -- ShortAns_arg
Now, there's a Y equals X squared. Yeah. -- Ack
So around here, round this bit, <pause> there won't be any difference. Hmm. -- Ack
Erm <pause> people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five. Yeah. -- Ack
But you'd miss a lot of important points. Yeah. -- Ack
But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like? <unclear> <pause> Ten times. -- ShortAns_arg
Roughly. A million times minus a million? -- CE
A million times minus a million? Minus. <unclear> -- RepAck
What's plus three times minus three? Three. -- ShortAns_arg
What's plus three times plus three? <shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> Nine. -- ShortAns_arg
<shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> Nine. Right. -- Ack
<pause> And, minus three times minus three? <pause> Minus nine. -- ShortAns_arg
Minus nine. No. -- Reject
Minus three times minus three? <unclear> <u who=PS3SS> Oh nine. <u who=PS3SR> -- ShortAns_arg
Oh nine. <u who=PS3SR> Right. -- Ack
And what is the sign of it though? Minus. -- ShortAns_arg
It's the same <unclear> Right. -- Ack
So <trunc> wh </trunc> when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten Yeah. -- Ack
this looks like Y equals minus X squared. <pause> Mm. -- Ack
It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful. Mm. -- Ack
Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient? Yeah. -- AffAns
And you measured it with a protractor, Mm. -- Ack
it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one. Yeah. <unclear> -- Ack
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be <pause> let's say someone gave you this <pause> find an approximation for the gradient <pause> erm Y equals X squared <pause> minus one. <vocal desc=laugh> X squared? -- CE
you <trunc> d </trunc> you'd have to find Y. Okay. -- Ack
So Y is three squared minus one. Yeah okay. -- Ack
<unclear> be Y would equal eight. Yeah. -- Ack
<unclear> <pause> the opposite point. Right. -- Ack
<shift new=whispering> <unclear> <shift> It'd be about one <unclear>. About one. -- RepAck
What, what would Y be? A million squared. -- ShortAns_arg
What, what would Y be? Yeah. -- Ack
<pause dur=32> <unclear> I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be <unclear> is more or less big enough. Mm. -- Ack

Erm a no problem with er work permits and things like that? No. -- Reject
I've got dual nationality. Okay fine. -- Ack
Right well obviously that those last five years have been the er the important ones for us. Mhm. -- Ack
erm possibly that I would have emphasized er the fact that we don't do quote fact to fact selling Mhm. -- Ack
of advertising Mhm. -- Ack
we are really er I'm preaching the company policy and also something I know that er works Mhm. -- Ack
Right no qualifying in in in er I will tell you what the <unclear> erm er sort of policy on that or opinion on that is that if you have got er a closure on the phone. Mhm. -- Ack
Now you must have at some time or other in advertising closed the deal on the phone. Oh yeah mhm. -- Ack
Well that's that's what we mean by that. Right. -- Ack
I have I would say that most of the people who answer yes who have been in say for instance home improvements Mhm. -- Ack
Whereas we think Yeah. -- Ack
it's more towards the no. Yes. -- Ack
Because they cannot discuss the requirements on the phone. Mhm. -- Ack
When you say those you mean the golf cards? Yeah. -- AffAns
That that type of idea. Right. -- Ack
Well er er erm the the whole point of about asking that sort of question is that er I in my own mind I know where I think Yeah. -- Ack
Er now we've got but we do have two products there of equal standing in terms of product er sorry of of erm salary potential Mhm. -- Ack
remuneration Yeah. -- Ack
Erm now John's on folders but there is another product range and that's the er This one. -- Filler
Well G A <trunc> be </trunc> based in Perth of course is er one of our major clients up here. Mhm. -- Ack
Er and once again they they they're all part of estates division and er you know they're as equally <trunc> valua </trunc> valuable to the er Yeah yeah. -- Ack
Erm I know some companies actually sell send the large ones out Yes. -- Ack
Yes they're not really meant to be sent out Yeah. -- Ack
I have to say though first of all especially if they have the larger version Mhm. -- Ack
Well thing is people are moving to an area they may be given some information by their company but Mhm. -- Ack
You'd still be in estates division Yeah. -- Ack
Erm but in the end it's all estates division anyway. Yeah. -- Ack
Er while I'm having a look through this er Richard er over there we have erm a selection of the product selection of the product which erm we discussed briefly on the phone. All right. -- Ack
There's a signature coming up is there? erm certainly the average cost of an ad if you took the most expensive and the least expensive across all of those products would come out somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds. Per ad? -- CE
Per ad? Per ad. -- RepAffAns
Per ad. But what size ad? -- Sluice
If you look at a full page when they happen, they don't happen all that often on a schools portfolio which costs two thousand two hundred pounds, you'll see there's there's already three different prices Yeah. -- Ack
So you will go in you will never come out of a an advertiser with less commission than that. Right. -- Ack
Unless you have discounted it and you give two or three pounds away when you do that. Right. -- Ack
But in the main we are looking for er somewhere in the region of er hundred and eighty pounds per per per deal and we're looking for one of those a day average. Mhm. -- Ack
Our top people earn top money because A they're not satisfied with one deal a day. Mhm. -- Ack
An assignment being one complete One complete product yes. -- Filler
Possibly a solicitor now they're allowed to advertise. And a solicitor. -- RepAck
The training course would certainly do that. Right. -- Ack
said Richard he said, I don't know how you do it in London he said, if they ever asked me to come down here he said I would die. Yeah. -- Ack

There are my notes and that it absolutely critical for us to know. All right yes. -- Ack
It's quite a different coloured pen. Yeah. -- Ack
Well first of all whether the the whole environment of selling advertising appeals. Mhm. -- Ack
But I've actually spoken to an even a a real Tyne and Wear Geordie accent Yes. -- Ack
I say I'm sorry I cannot understand a word you're saying. Yes. -- Ack
er so it wouldn't be any good for us. Mhm. -- Ack
I say well it's definitely the latter. The latter. <vocal desc=laugh> -- RepAck
But there is a certain element of the former. Yes. -- Ack
Because in any self employed situation you're always going to get people who find something quote better Mhm. -- Ack
in their opinion and that's that and and they get it. Mhm. -- Ack
Well when you when you understand er when you get to understand the products I mean there's there all our six companies are represented over there er Maggie Right. -- Ack
And that is bring together the advertising to fund the product. Mhm. -- Ack
you see this this this one you brought in here Mhm. -- Ack
unless the local printer's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they've had to charge for it. Mhm. -- Ack
And I was disappointed I went and say, Hey Mm. -- Ack
